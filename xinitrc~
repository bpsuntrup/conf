# by startx, which I'm currently starting in my .bash_profile (under specific,
# sane conditions).

# For now there is no .xsession, because I do not use a display manager. I

# This looks for the window manager executable in the shell variable $WM, currently
# defaulting to i3. So to use a different window manager, justdo something like:
