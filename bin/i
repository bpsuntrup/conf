# of what I've put on my computer and why so I can reproduce the system if I ever migrate.
# Also so that I can slim it down if I ever want to uninstall packages I don't use anymore.
#
# All arguments go to xbps-install. This simply asks for a reason and then logs it.
# This depends on the script `il` being installed
