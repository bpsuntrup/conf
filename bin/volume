# Uses pulseaudio utilities to set volume on all sinks. This could be
# more sophisticated. Could take options for headphones or otherwise.
# This is fine for now. I'm going to use it in my dwm config
#
# update 25 Nov 2023: I will not put this in my dwm config. I've 
# figured out a solution using xbindkeys (see xbindkeysrc).
# I'm keeping this anyway in case I decide to make it fancier in
# the future, I can use this script, but it's not going into my
# window manager.
